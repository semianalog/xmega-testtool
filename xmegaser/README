USB clocking
------------

In most cases, it is the responsibility of the user to configure the USB clock.
If USB_DEVICE_LOW_SPEED is defined in conf_usb.h, clkUSB should be 6 MHz.
Otherwise it should be 48 MHz. The following clock configurations are provided
and can be used if they are sufficient:

    xmegaser_clock_fast_nopll();
        Fastest configuration that can be used without the PLL.

        intRC at 48MHz -----+---------------> USB (48 MHz)
                            |
                            +----(div 2)----> sysclk (24 MHz)

    xmegaser_clock_fast_pll();
        Fastest configuration that can be used with the PLL.

        intRC at 32 MHz ----+-(pll *3)---(div 2)---> USB (48 MHz)
                            |
                            +----------------------> sysclk (32 MHz)

    xmegaser_enable_dfll(DFLL_INTERNAL);
    xmegaser_enable_dfll(DFLL_EXTERNAL);
        Augments xmegaser_clock_fast_pll() with the DFLL, locked either to the
        internal precision 32.768 kHz oscillator, or to an external
        32.768 kHz crystal.
